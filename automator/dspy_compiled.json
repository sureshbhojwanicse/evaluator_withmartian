When they and the British were beaten, the Americans burned their crops and villages.  The Cherokee knew they could never win against Americans who were taking over their land so in 1795 they signed a treaty with the new United States government.  In the agreement, the Cherokee said they would stay on their lands in Georgia and other states peacefully.  In return, the US said that no white person could come into their lands without the permission of the Cherokee. \nLater during the War of 1812, the Cherokee actually helped the Americans fight against the British.  The Cherokee leader, Major Ridge, wanted his people to get along with Americans.  The problem was that in 1829, gold was found on Cherokee lands.  White settlers started to pour into the area which broke the treaty that the Cherokee had with the United States.  Andrew Jackson supported the settlers and asked Congress to remove the Cherokee.  The Cherokees were betrayed. \nIn 1830, the Cherokee gave white settlers a warning and told them they had to move out.  They then burned down the houses of the white settlers.  White settlers throughout Georgia became angry and started attacking the Cherokee in return.\n \n1\u2013 Based on this reading, identify 3 cause and effect relationships:\nA-\n \nB-\n \nC-\n\n\n[The Start of Reference Answer]\nA- Cause: The discovery of gold on Cherokee lands Effect: White settlers began pouring into the area, breaking the treaty between the Cherokee and the United States.\n\nB- Cause: Andrew Jackson supported the white settlers and asked Congress to remove the Cherokee.

How can I assist you today?user: Why would my former friend talk to me like I was stupid even though she said many times how smart I was assistant: It can be confusing and hurtful when someone who previously praised your intelligence now speaks to you in a condescending or dismissive manner. There could be a variety of reasons for this change in behavior:\n\n1. Insecurity: Sometimes, people may put others down or speak condescendingly to them out of their own insecurities. Your former friend may feel threatened by your intelligence and accomplishments, leading her to belittle you in an attempt to feel better about herself.\n\n2. Control: Some individuals may engage in condescending behavior as a way to assert power or control over others. By speaking to you in a derogatory manner, your former friend may be trying to manipulate or undermine your confidence.\n\n3. Conflict or Resentment: It's possible that there may have been a shift in your relationship dynamic that led to underlying conflict or resentment. Your former friend may be expressing her negative feelings towards you through condescending language, as a way to put you down or express her dissatisfaction.\n\n4. Miscommunication: Sometimes, miscommunication or misunderstandings can lead to someone unintentionally speaking in a condescending manner. It's possible that your former friend's words or tone were misconstrued, and she may not have intended to come across as disrespectful.\n\n5. Changing Perspectives: People's views and opinions can change over time, and your former friend may have shifted her perspective on your intelligence for reasons that are personal to her. This change in perception could be influencing the way she communicates with you.\n\nIn any case, it's important to communicate openly and honestly with your former friend about how her words make you feel. Expressing your thoughts and concerns can help clarify the situation and potentially lead to a resolution. If the condescending behavior continues or is causing you distress, it may be worth reevaluating the friendship and setting boundaries to protect your well-being.

I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress-and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n\"'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.\"\n\"What's the matter, Daisy?\"\nI was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.\n\"Here, deares.\" She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.\n\"Take 'em down-stairs and give 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change her mine. Say: 'Daisy's change her mine!'\"\nShe began to cry\u2014she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother's maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\nBut she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months' trip to the South Seas. \u2022\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I'd never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he\u201d\n\n\u201cleft the room for a minute shed look around uneasily, and say:\n\"Where's Tom gone?\" and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together\u2014it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken\u2014she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.\nPerhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all\u2014 and yet there's something in that voice of hers....\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you\u2014do you remember?\u2014if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him\u2014I was half asleep\u2014 she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear voices of little girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n\"I'm the Sheik of Araby.\nYour love belongs to me.\nAt night when you're asleep\nInto your tent I'll creep-\n\"\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said\n\"But it wasn't a coincidence at all.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor.\n\"He wants to know,\" continued Jordan, \"if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths\u2014so that he could \"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\n\"He's afraid, he's waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see, he's a regular tough underneath it all.\"\u201d\nassistant: On pages 76-78 of \"The Great Gatsby,\" Daisy gets extremely drunk on her wedding day and demands to return a valuable gift of pearls.
